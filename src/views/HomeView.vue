        <p class="text-sm mb-3">Artâ€™s historically low correlation to the stock market, potentially lucrative returns,
          and
          potential ability to hedge against inflation makes art investment funds a much sought after investment
          opportunity for
          investors</p>
        <p class="text-sm mb-6">The big caveat is, the entry is high, and you need to be in the know. Artemis Collective lets
          you invest into part of a bluechip artwork, according to your appetite.</p>
