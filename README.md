# Artemis Collective

Art investment has been a desirable asset class, outperforming the S&P500 historically. However, it is only accessible
to the wealthy and connected. Artemis Collective aims to democratize art investment with Tokenized Fractional RWA on the
Aptos blockchain.

# Aptos Blockchain

Leveraging the Aptos blockchain, Artemis Collective provides a secure, efficient, and scalable platform for art asset
tokenization. Aptos's resource-oriented architecture facilitates structural and efficient tokenization and
fractionalization without the need for deploying separate smart contracts for different resources like the ERC-7631.

We make use of the native Digital Asset and Fungible Asset standards that offer a unified framework for creating,
managing, and transferring digital representations of real-world assets. These standards ensure compatibility and
interoperability across the ecosystem, while also simplify the process of tokenizing physical art assets and its
fractional representation. This approach greatly reduces complexity and significantly mitigates security risks associated with deploying multiple
smart contracts, and the needs for these smart contracts to communicate.

Aptos blockchain's high throughput and optimized performance effectively also negate the gas fee issues that plague other
blockchain platforms.
